Personal project for a tower defense game based on a hex grid.
This project is done in Godot and written in GDS.

The goal is to have a functional tower defense game where the player controls an island and encounters waves of enemies attacking his castle on the island by challenging other islands. When the player emerges victorious, he gains a power up which helps him challenge stronger islands.

This my attempt at a roguelike tower defense.
